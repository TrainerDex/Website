"                      <p>You most likely had a <em>phantom goal</em> This "
"isn't anything to do with Danny Phantom, ghosts or an own goal nobody wants "
"to own up to. Instead, this related to goals shown by the Discord bot. "
"Before the 22nd December, once you reached your goal the bot would reset it "
"to zero. Anybody below Level 40 and a zero goal was assigned a phantom goal "
"as a promotion for goals.</p>\n"
"                      \n"
"                      <p>Since then, the default behaviour is to "
"automatically move your goal on to the next level when you reach your goal, "
"rather than resetting to zero. To give the user a choice <em>not</em> to "
"have a goal. We removed phantom goals. Phantom goals didn't congratulate the "
"user either, whereas set goals do.</p>\n"
