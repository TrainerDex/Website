# TrainerDex

Okay, so, some history on this repo. It's old, and messy. Very messy. It was private for a very long time.
It was started by @Azelphur for a PokÃ©mon Go mapping project, and then I added code for what was originally supposed to be the backend of a small Discord bot for 3-4 servers.
As such, TrainerDex was never future proofed. I have used [BFG Repo Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to remove any secret keys or passwords. 
As of 305f5aa307ddb9ef1e7e85c6d66ce2192d83b042, the code should work with a few tweaks, however, I plan to make it Docker compatible.

Thir project is now sponsored by [Wynaut Wyandotte](https://discord.gg/jJKVAPw4Pw).
